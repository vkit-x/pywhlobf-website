## What is this project?

`pywhlobf` specializes in safeguarding your valuable source code and helping you secure your intellectual property. It does so by converting your `.py` Python source code into a compiled shared library, which is a `.so` file in Linux/macOS or a `.pyd` file in Windows. By doing so, you can distribute your compiled code to others while keeping your source implementation confidential.
